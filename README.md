Model 2 uses logistic Regression.  This model performed better than Model 1 using SVC.  Neither model performed very well.  Using a neural network would have produced a better model.  I tried using a neural network with Sequential(), 100 nodes in 2 hidden layers.  This model performed better.  I was not able to successfully use the grid search with this model, so that model was not included here.
